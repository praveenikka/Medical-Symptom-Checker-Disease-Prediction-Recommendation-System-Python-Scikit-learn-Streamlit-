# Medical Symptom Checker & Disease Prediction System

This project uses machine learning to predict diseases based on patient symptoms, age, and gender with high accuracy. The system ranks the top three possible diseases, provides confidence scores, and offers actionable health recommendations. A Streamlit web app enables users to input symptoms interactively, visualize predictions, and receive user-friendly feedback in real time.
